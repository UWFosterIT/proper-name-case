# Proper Name Name

Attempt to properly case a person's name. It should noted that without creating a massive lookup table this can only be partially complete. This module adjusts casing based on patterns of common casing quirks (O'Brien, McDonald, Baron von Mustache, etc.) but there will always be exceptions.
